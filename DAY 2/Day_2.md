# DAY 2


## Complete Unit 2: ‚ÄúEmbeddings and Vector Stores/Databases‚Äù

* Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit: <br>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCAVsst6WJ8&list=PLqFaTIg4myu_yKJpvF8WE2JfaG5kGuvoE&index=3)

* To complement the podcast, read the ‚ÄúEmbeddings and Vector Stores/Databases‚Äù whitepaper: <br>(https://kaggle.com/whitepaper-embeddings-and-vector-stores)

* Complete these code labs on Kaggle:

    * Build a RAG question-answering system over custom documents: <br>(https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-2-document-q-a-with-rag)

    * Explore text similarity with embeddings: <br>(https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-2-embeddings-and-similarity-scores)

    * Build a neural classification network with Keras using embeddings: <br>(https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-2-classifying-embeddings-with-keras)

## üí°What You‚Äôll Learn

* Today you will learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. <br>You‚Äôll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data as well as how to evaluate embeddings.
