How the Course Works:

## Notes

* The 24-hour period begins when the assignment is shared with you (participants) and ends after the YouTube livestream concludes. For Day 1, the whitepapers, podcasts, and codelabs are provided to help you get started on the coursework. The YouTube livestream is scheduled for 11 a.m. PT tomorrow (3/31), during which the host and guests will discuss an overview of the whitepaper, answer multiple questions, go over the codelabs, and host a pop quiz. I hope this helps for you all to get started!
