## üí°What You‚Äôll Learn:

* Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process. <br>You'll also learn more about advanced agentic architectures and approaches such as multi-agent systems, agent evaluation and more.

* The codelabs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. <br>Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot (including an example using Gemini 2.0‚Äôs Live API: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live). <br>Additionally you‚Äôll learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a caf√©.
