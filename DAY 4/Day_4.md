## üí°What You‚Äôll Learn:

* In today‚Äôs reading, you‚Äôll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

* In the codelabs, you'll learn how to add real-world data to a model using Google Search and then visualize it with plotting tools via the Live API. <br>
You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.
